# [Results](https://github.com/josdas/Text-search-in-video/blob/master/RESULTS.MD)

# Done:
-   dense network
-   use pre-trained VGG16 and word2vec
-   bot for demo
-   all preprocessor for text and frames
-   CNN for matrix
-   multicore frames process
-   training with COCO dataset
-   smoothing search in video

# ToDo:
-   DSSM
-   deeper, deeper and deeper
-   training embedding
-   training VGG16
-   use state-of-the-art network
-   make preprocessor faster
